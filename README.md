This repository contains full MATLAB source code and scripts
implementing integrated analysis of genetic variants and pathways in
genome-wide association studies of seven common diseases: bipolar
disorder, coronary artery disease, Crohn's disease, hypertension,
rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. This MATLAB
code includes statistical procedures to (1) interrogate pathways for
enrichment of disease associations in genome-wide data, and (2) to
prioritize variants assigned to enriched pathways in an attempt to
enhance discovery of genes underlying complex diseases. Our procedures
are based on fitting multi-marker models of disease to the data. We
use Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to quantify support for enriched
pathways, and to infer disease associations across the genome.

*R implementations of these statistical procedures are forthcoming.*
