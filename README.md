This repository contains full MATLAB source code and scripts
implementing integrated analysis of genetic variants and pathways in
genome-wide association studies of seven common diseases: bipolar
disorder (BD), coronary artery disease (CAD), Crohn's disease (CD),
hypertension (HT), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D)
and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This MATLAB code includes statistical
procedures to (1) interrogate pathways for enrichment of disease
associations in genome-wide data, and (2) to prioritize variants
assigned to enriched pathways in an attempt to enhance discovery of
genes underlying complex diseases. Our procedures are based on fitting
multi-marker models of disease to the data. We use Bayesian model
averaging (BMA) to quantify support for enriched pathways, and to
infer disease associations across the genome.

*R implementations of these statistical procedures are forthcoming.*
