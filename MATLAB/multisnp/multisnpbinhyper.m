% [LOGW,ALPHA,MU,S,ETA] = MULTISNPBINHYPER(X,Y,H,LOG10ODDS) runs the full
% variational inference procedure for Bayesian variable selection in
% logistic regression (for a binary trait). The first part to the algorithm
% searches for a good initialization of the variational parameters.
% 
% This inference procedure involves an inner loop and an outer loop. The
% inner loop consists of running a coordinate ascent algorithm to tighten
% the variational lower bound given a setting of the hyperparameters. The
% outer loop computes importance weights for all combinations of the
% hyperparameters.
%
% Input X is the genotype data. It is an N x P matrix, where N is the number
% of samples (individuals), and P is the number of variables (genetic loci,
% or SNPs). Y is the vector of binary trait data, such as case-control
% status; it is a vector of length N. It is important to note that X and Y
% should *not* be centered. Instead, we account for the intercept while we
% update the variational approximation.
%
% Inputs H and LOG10ODDS are the hyperparameter settings: H is the prior
% proportion of variance explained, and LOG10ODDS is the (base 10) logarithm
% of the prior odds for inclusion; it is equal to LOG10ODDS =
% LOG10(Q./(1-Q)), where Q is the prior probability that each SNP is
% included in the linear model of Y. These two inputs must be arrays of the
% same size. Note that a residual variance parameter SIGMA is not needed to
% model a binary trait. For each combination of the hyperparameters, we
% compute the unnormalized log-importance weight, and store the result in
% output LOGW.
%
% We assume a uniform prior on the proportion of variance explained, H. The
% prior on LOG10ODDS is uniform over the interval given by the candidate
% values of LOG10ODDS. Assuming a uniform proposal distribution for the
% hyperparameters H and LOG10ODDS, the importance sampling procedure will
% recover the correct distribution of H and LOG10ODDS as the number of Monte
% Carlo samples becomes large, and assuming the variational approximation
% closely matches the exact posterior. See PVE2SA for how to obtain the
% prior variance of the additive effects.
%
% Outputs ALPHA, MU and S are variational estimates of the posterior
% inclusion probabilities, and posterior means and variances of the additive
% effects (given that the variable is included in the model) for each
% setting of the hyperparameters. ALPHA, MU and S are each a matrix of
% dimension P x NS, where NS is the number of hyperparameter settings. Each
% column of ETA is the set of parameters specifying the variational
% approximation to logistic regression factors, conditioned on the
% hyperparameter settings. ETA is an N x NS matrix.
